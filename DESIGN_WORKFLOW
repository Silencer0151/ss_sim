Phase 1: Basic 2D Simulation (The Core)

The goal of this phase is to establish the fundamental physics and a simple visualization. This is the most critical part of the project.

    Implement CelestialBody Class:

        Create a simple data class to hold the properties of a celestial body (mass, position, velocity). This part of the code is already done with the boilerplate.

    Populate the Simulation:

        In your main.cpp file, add a few test bodies to the NBodySimulation instance, such as a large sun and a small earth.

    Develop the Physics Loop:

        In the NBodySimulation::step() method, write the code to calculate the gravitational force between your bodies and update their positions. Start with a simple scenario, like just two bodies, to ensure the physics is working correctly.

    Create a Basic 2D Renderer:

        In the SolarSystemWidget::paintEvent(), use QPainter to draw simple circles to represent the sun and planets based on their positions and radii. This provides a visual feedback loop for your physics.

    Connect the Pieces:

        Ensure the QTimer in NBodySimulation is correctly connected to the step() method and that the simulationStepCompleted() signal correctly triggers the updateView() slot in your widget.

At the end of this phase, you should have a working 2D simulation where planets orbit realistically.

Phase 2: Refined Physics and Interactive Controls

With a working simulation, the next step is to make it more realistic and interactive.

    Improve the Physics:

        Implement a more stable numerical integration method, such as the Velocity Verlet method. While the simple method from Phase 1 might work, a more advanced method will provide more accurate orbits over a longer period.

    Add all Solar System Planets:

        Create and add all the planets in our solar system, with their real-world mass, initial position, and velocity data (you can find this data online).

    Build a Basic UI:

        Use Qt Widgets to add buttons for Play, Pause, and Time Warp. Connect these buttons to slots in your NBodySimulation class to control the QTimer.

        For time warp, you can have buttons that adjust the timer's interval to speed up or slow down the simulation.

Phase 3: Transition to 3D Visualization

This is where the project starts to become "stunning." You will replace the 2D QPainter with a 3D rendering pipeline using OpenGL.

    Switch to QOpenGLWidget:

        Modify your SolarSystemWidget to inherit from QOpenGLWidget. This gives you an OpenGL rendering context.

    Learn Basic OpenGL:

        Familiarize yourself with core OpenGL concepts: shaders (GLSL), vertex buffer objects (VBOs), and matrix transformations (model, view, projection).

    Implement the 3D Renderer:

        Write an initializeGL() method to set up your OpenGL context.

        In your paintGL() method, use shaders and VBOs to draw 3D spheres for each celestial body, using their QVector3D positions from the NBodySimulation.

    Add a 3D Camera:

        Implement a simple 3D camera class.

        Use mouse and keyboard events in your widget to control the camera, allowing the user to pan, zoom, and orbit the solar system.

Phase 4: Advanced Features and Polish

This final phase adds the "wow" factor and prepares the project for distribution.

    Introduce Asteroids:

        Implement a feature to generate hundreds of asteroids with randomized initial positions and velocities, placing them in a specific region, such as between Jupiter and Earth. This will be a great test of your physics engine's performance.

    Add Visual Effects:

        Create a background starfield.

        Implement optional orbital trail rendering to show the path of the planets over time.

    Performance Optimization:

        With a large number of bodies, your physics loop's performance will become a bottleneck (O(n2) complexity). Look into optimization techniques if necessary.

    Final Polish and Distribution:

        Create a polished user interface.

        Follow the deployment process we discussed to create a standalone, distributable version of your application using windeployqt.
